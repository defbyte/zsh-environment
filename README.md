My personal zsh environment/dotfiles. Feel free to steal ideas. I originally forked [Corey's bash environment repo](https://github.com/csuhta/environment), but have now create a separate one for my current zsh setup. Nonetheless, still inspired by Corey.

A lot of things here are custom to my system and macOS, your milage may vary.

- `./osx.sh` — Configures macOS defaults
- `./install.sh` — Installs these environment files
- `./homebrew.sh` — Installs some basic goodies via Homebrew
